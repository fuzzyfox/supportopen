# Support Open Community Quilt
A user generated quilt of tagged makes.

## Usage
### Configuration
The quilt has some builtin default options (seen below) which can be overridden on initilization, or via page querystring.

	var config = {
		tags: [ 'supportopen', 'webwewant', 'millionmozillians' ],
		execution: 'or',
		limit: 100,
		duration: 7000
	};

	Quilt( config );

#### Configure by URL
* **Tags:** `tags=comma,separated,list,of,tags`
* **Execution:** `execution=or`
* **Limit:** `limit=100`
* **Duration:** `duration=7000`

**Example** showing how to fetch only 10 makes tagged `supportopen` **and** `mozfest`, and show each for 10 seconds.

## Development
Play nice:

* remove trailing whitespace from files before save
* don't use non-ascii file names
* run grunt before commit (and make sure there are no errors)

Do all this w/ ease!

	mv .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit
	echo "\n# run grunt before commit, abort if errors\ngrunt" >> .git/hooks/pre-commit
